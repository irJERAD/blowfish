## Who am I?

As an adventurer I love to sail, surf, and when I can't hit the ocean I'll take my surfskate for a cruise. As an explorer I have lived up and down Califonia's coast - San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Francisco - as well as the South Pacific Island of Tahiti and New Zealand. As a life long learner I am in pursuit of my next certification or digging around the corners of a favorite pastime.

Data or information, knowledge, and the value they can perform is the economy I work in. Building interactive dashboards for real-time action oriented decision making. The crawling, the collecting, the exploring, mutating and munging, working intimately with data to reveal true value and insights.

I work with young students in their mid-teens as a tutor. A [growth mindset](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/) and [the power of 'Yet'](https://youtu.be/hiiEeMN7vbQ) are core to my program. Inspiring in students an ownership of their academics. I mentor them to become self-guided learners. Teaching them to [meditate on a love for learning](/posts/meditate-on-a-love-for-learning) and devote themselves to an [appreciation of their educational opportunity](/posts/appreciation-of-our-educational-opportunity).
